### üîç Detailed Observations

1. **Critical Path Reduction**  
   - The addition of a **pipeline register** reduces the maximum combinational delay from **~10.2 ns ‚Üí 6.0 ns**.  
   - This directly translates to higher achievable clock frequencies.

2. **Frequency Improvement**  
   - Maximum frequency increased by **~70%** (from 98 MHz ‚Üí 166 MHz).  
   - Pipelining enables faster operation without violating timing constraints.

3. **Slack Analysis**  
   - Non-pipelined ALU shows **negative WNS**, indicating timing violations at 10 ns clock period.  
   - Pipelined ALU achieves **positive WNS**, confirming timing robustness.

4. **Throughput Impact**  
   - Even a **single-stage pipeline** improves throughput and ensures timing safety, demonstrating the **power of pipelining in digital design**.
